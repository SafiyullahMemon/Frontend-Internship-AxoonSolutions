# Frontend – AXOON Internship Project

This repository contains the frontend development tasks completed during my internship at **Axoon Solutions**. The project showcases an eCommerce website UI using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and basic **JavaScript** for structure and interactivity.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```

AXOON_FD_03/        // Deals of the Month section
